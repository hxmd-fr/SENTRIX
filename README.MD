# ðŸ¤–SENTRIX - AI Research Assistant
This project is a web-based AI agent that automates the research process. Given a single research goal, the agent autonomously searches the web for relevant sources, scrapes their content, and synthesizes the information into a comprehensive, well-formatted report.

## Key Features
Autonomous Research: Provide a high-level goal, and the agent handles the entire research workflow.

Dynamic Source-Finding: Uses the SerpApi service to perform real-time Google searches for the most relevant and up-to-date articles.

Web Content Extraction: Automatically scrapes and parses the text content from multiple source URLs.

AI-Powered Synthesis: Leverages the Google Gemini API to read the collected information and generate a cohesive, structured report.

Markdown Formatting: The final report is formatted with Markdown for clear headings, lists, and structure.
